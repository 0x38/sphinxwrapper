# pocketsphinx-c-python
Python C extension for Pocket Sphinx and other CMU Sphinx libraries for interaction with [Dragonfly](https://github.com/t4ngo/dragonfly)

This is a work in progress, but this project aims to create a backend for using Pocket Sphinx with 
[Dragonfly](https://github.com/t4ngo/dragonfly) for the excellent macroing support it offers. 
The engine backend for dragonfly might go up in this repository or in 
[my fork of Dragonfly](https://github.com/Danesprite/dragonfly).
